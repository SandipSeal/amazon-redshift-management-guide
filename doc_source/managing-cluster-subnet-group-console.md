# Managing Cluster Subnet Groups Using the Console<a name="managing-cluster-subnet-group-console"></a>

The section explains how to manage your cluster subnet groups using the Amazon Redshift console\. You can create a cluster subnet group, manage an existing one, or delete one\. All of these tasks start from the cluster subnet group list\. You must select a cluster subnet group to manage it\.

In the example cluster subnet group list below, there is one cluster subnet group\. By default, there are no cluster subnet groups defined for your AWS account\. Because `my-subnet-group` is selected \(highlighted\), you can edit or delete it\. The details of the selected security group are shown under **Cluster Subnet Group Details**\.
