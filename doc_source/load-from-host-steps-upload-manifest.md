# Step 6: Upload the Manifest File to an Amazon S3 Bucket<a name="load-from-host-steps-upload-manifest"></a>

Upload the manifest file to an Amazon S3 bucket\. If the Amazon S3 bucket does not reside in the same region as your Amazon Redshift cluster, you must use the [REGION](copy-parameters-data-source-s3.md#copy-region) option to specify the region in which the manifest is located\. For information about creating an Amazon S3 bucket and uploading a file, see [Amazon Simple Storage Service Getting Started Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/)\.
