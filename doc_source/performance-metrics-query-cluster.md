# Viewing Cluster Performance During Query Execution<a name="performance-metrics-query-cluster"></a>

You can use the **Cluster Performance During Query Execution** section of the **Query** view to see cluster metrics during query execution\. Doing so helps identify poorly performing queries, look for bottleneck queries, and determine if you need to resize your cluster for your workload\.

1. In the query list, find the query you want to work with, and choose the query ID in the **Query** column\.

   In the following example, the queries are sorted by **Run time** to find the query with the maximum run time\.

1. In the **Query** page that opens, scroll to the **Cluster Performance During Query Execution** section to view cluster metrics\.

   In the following example, the `CPUUtilization` and `NetworkReceiveThroughput` metrics are displayed for the time that this query was running\.
**Tip**  
You can close the details of the **Query Execution Details** or **SQL** sections to manage how much information is displayed in the pane\.
