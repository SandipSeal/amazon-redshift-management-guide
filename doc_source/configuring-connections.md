# Configuring Connections in Amazon Redshift<a name="configuring-connections"></a>

Use this section to learn how to configure JDBC and ODBC connections to connect to your cluster from SQL client tools\. This section describes how to set up JDBC and ODBC connections and how to use Secure Sockets Layer \(SSL\) and server certificates to encrypt communication between the client and server\.

## JDBC and ODBC Drivers for Amazon Redshift<a name="connecting-drivers"></a>

To work with data in your cluster, you need JDBC or ODBC drivers for connectivity from your client computer or instance\. Code your applications to use JDBC or ODBC data access APIs, and use SQL client tools that support either JDBC or ODBC\.

Amazon Redshift offers JDBC and ODBC drivers for download\. Previously, Amazon Redshift recommended PostgreSQL drivers for JDBC and ODBC; if you are currently using those drivers, we recommend moving to the new Amazon Redshiftâ€“specific drivers going forward\. For more information about how to download the JDBC and ODBC drivers and configure connections to your cluster, see [Configure a JDBC Connection](configure-jdbc-connection.md) and [Configure an ODBC Connection](configure-odbc-connection.md)\. 

## Finding Your Cluster Connection String<a name="connecting-connection-string"></a>

To connect to your cluster with your SQL client tool, you need the cluster connection string\. You can find the cluster connection string in the Amazon Redshift console, on a cluster's configuration page\.

**To get your cluster connection string**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Redshift console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/redshift/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift/)\.

1. On the **Clusters** page, click the name of the cluster for which you want to get the connection string\.

1. On the cluster's **Configuration** tab, under **JDBC URL** or **ODBC URL**, copy the connection string\.

   The following example shows the connection strings of a cluster launched in the US West region\. If you launched your cluster in a different region, the connection strings will be based that region's endpoint\.
