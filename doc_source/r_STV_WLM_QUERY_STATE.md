## Sample Query<a name="r_STV_WLM_QUERY_STATE-sample-query"></a>

The following query displays all currently executing queries in service classes greater than 4\. For a list of service class IDs, see [WLM Service Class IDs](cm-c-wlm-system-tables-and-views.md#wlm-service-class-ids)\.

```
select xid, query, trim(state), queue_time, exec_time
from stv_wlm_query_state
where service_class > 4;
```

This query returns the following sample output: 

```
xid    | query | btrim   | queue_time | exec_time
