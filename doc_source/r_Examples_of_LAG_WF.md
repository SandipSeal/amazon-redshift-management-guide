# LAG Window Function Examples<a name="r_Examples_of_LAG_WF"></a>

 The following example shows the quantity of tickets sold to the buyer with a buyer ID of 3 and the time that buyer 3 bought the tickets\. To compare each sale with the previous sale for buyer 3, the query returns the previous quantity sold for each sale\. Since there is no purchase before 1/16/2008, the first previous quantity sold value is null: 

```
select buyerid, saletime, qtysold,
lag(qtysold,1) over (order by buyerid, saletime) as prev_qtysold
from sales where buyerid = 3 order by buyerid, saletime;

buyerid |      saletime       | qtysold | prev_qtysold
